# dario 🖊️

A minimal hugo theme inspired by Dario Amodei's personal [website](https://darioamodei.com/). It is designed to be as minimal, performant, and as elegant as possible for reading.

View the [live demo](https://log.birki.io) to see what it looks like ([source code](https://github.com/GrantBirki/dario)).

## Installation

> To view a real example of a project using this theme, check out [grantbirki/log](https://github.com/GrantBirki/log) which is where I have the demo deployed.

You can install this theme in one of the following ways:

### The Source

Download the source of this repo (dario) [as a zip from GitHub](https://github.com/GrantBirki/dario/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract in your themes directory at `<my_site>/themes/dario`.

Then, once you have the theme extracted, you can add it to your site's `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "dario"
```

### As a Git Submodule

Alternatively, if your site is a Git repo, you can add this theme as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) instead of downloading it as a zip:

```bash
cd <my_site>
git submodule add https://github.com/GrantBirki/dario.git themes/dario
git commit -m "Add dario theme as submodule"
```

Add it to your site's `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "dario"
```

To upgrade to the latest version of the theme:

```bash
cd <my_site>
cd themes/dario
git checkout main
git pull
cd ../..
git commit themes/dario -m "Upgrade to latest dario theme"
```

### As a Hugo Module

And lastly, if you have the [latest version of Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), the best way to install this theme and keep up with improvements from time to time is to install it as a [Hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/).

Initialize your site:

```bash
hugo mod init yoursite.com
go mod edit -go=1.24
```

Add the following to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/GrantBirki/dario"
    version = "main"
```

Note that there's no `theme = "dario"` in this case. If you already have this in your `config.toml`, please remove it.

Fetch the theme:

```bash
hugo mod get github.com/GrantBirki/dario@main
hugo mod tidy
```

To upgrade to the latest version of the theme:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/GrantBirki/dario@main
hugo mod tidy
```

## Configuration

You can further configure how this site looks by editing your `config.toml` file. Here is an example of a configuration that works with this theme:

```toml
baseURL = "https://yoursite.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "log" # the title of your site

theme = "dario"

[params]
  author = "Your Name" # the author of the site
  description = "A description of your site" # a description of your site that will be used in the meta tags
```

To add intro text to your home page, create a file at `content/_index.md` with contents similar to the following:

```yaml
---
subtitle: "Home Page Subtitle" # the subtitle to display on the "/" homepage
description: "A minimal web log." # The description of the home page that will be used in the open graph meta tags
---

This is a minimal web log inspired by Dario Amodei's personal [website](https://darioamodei.com/). Add some more text here that will be displayed on your homepage (you can use markdown).
```

### Optional Settings

By default, the theme shows a toggle for switching between light and dark modes. To follow the user's system preference instead, set the `useSystemColorScheme` parameter:

```toml
[params]
  useSystemColorScheme = true
```

The home page shows the top-level section with the most pages by default. To override this, set `mainSections` to select specific sections:

```toml
mainSections = ['posts', 'essays', 'notes']
```

## Blog Posts

Creating a blog post follows the same general process as most Hugo blogging themes.

Posts have markdown "front matter" that looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: "An Example Writing"
author: ["hugo", "monalisa"] # can be an array or just a string
description: "On how to write an example blog post"

# The summary is for search engines
summary: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed neque elit, tristique placerat feugiat ac, facilisis vitae arcu. Proin eget egestas augue. Praesent ut sem nec arcu pellentesque aliquet. Duis dapibus diam vel metus tempus vulputate.

date: 2000-01-01T00:00:00-00:00 # date of creation

draft: false

ogTitle: Cool New Example Post # the title of the post that will be used in the open graph meta tags
ogDescription: "An example of using the Dario hugo theme" # the description of the post that will be used in the open graph meta tags
ogImage: /posts/example/og.png # the path to a png/jpg image in the ./posts/example directory to use as the open graph image
---

Here is where you write the content of your blog post in markdown!
```
